CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o readVcf() has genome argument, can be subset on ranges or VCF elements
      with ScanVcfParam()

    o scanVcfHeader() returns VCFHeader class with accessors fixed, info, geno,
      etc.

    o writeVcf() writes out a VCF file from a VCF class

    o locateVariants() 
        - returns GRanges instead of DataFrame
        - 'region' argument allows specification of variants by region 
        - output includes txID, geneID and cdsID
        - has cache argument for repeated calls over multiple vcf files

    o predictCoding()
        - returns GRanges instead of DataFrame
        - output includes txID, geneID, cdsID, 
          cds-based and protein-based coordinates
 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o readVcf() for reading and parsing VCF files into a SummarizedExperiment 

    o locateVariants() and predictCoding() for identifying amino acid coding
    changes in nonsynonymous variants
 
    o dbSNPFilter() and regionFilter() for filtering variants on membership in
    dbSNP or on a particular location in the genome
 
    o access to PolyPhen and SIFT predictions through keys() , cols() and
    select() methods. See ?SIFT or ?PolyPhen.
 

BUG FIXES

    o No changes classified as 'bug fixes' (package under active
