Short term
-------------------

- Michael's vectorized cum* methods in IRanges


- readVcf :

  o parse header of VCF files, use INFO to designate data types

  o deal with "imprecise" variants ALT field that contain descriptive alleles,
    should be marked by 'imprecise' flag in INFO

  o pick up strand bias in INFO$sb? 

  o if user does not supply a param :
    (i) if not compressed -> ok
    (ii) if compressed -> warning 

 
- locateVariants  :

  o findOverlaps needs zero-width implementation :

    (i) the only possible type of overlap between a zero-width and non-zero width
    interval is "within"
 
    (ii) overlap is defined as
 
        (x2 <= x1 <= y2) && (x2 <= y1 <= y2)
 
    where in this example I1 is found to be "within" I2.
 
    (iii) Herve's def2_truth table summarizes the expected hits

    ANY END START WITHIN EQUAL
    A 1 0 0 1 0
    B 1 0 0 1 0
    C 0 0 0 0 0
    D 0 0 0 0 0 


  o findOverlaps(type="within", ...) for all matches? NOTE : predictCoding
    uses type="within"
